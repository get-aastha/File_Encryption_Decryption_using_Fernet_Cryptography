# file_encryption_decryption_using_Fernet_cryptography

Encrypting multimedia files, including images, videos, and audio recordings using Fernet cipher. **Project report included**.

# Software Specification

1. Front-End Requirements:
   
HTML:
•	Ability to create a user interface for file selection (audio, video, image).
•	Ability to display options for encryption and decryption.
•	Ability to handle user input for the encryption key.
•	Ability to display progress indicators or success/error messages during encryption/decryption.

CSS:
•	Ability to style the user interface for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
•	Ability to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

JavaScript:
•	Ability to handle user interactions with the interface elements (file selection, button clicks, etc.).
•	Ability to communicate with the back-end server using techniques like AJAX or WebSockets for file upload/download and encryption/decryption requests.
•	Libraries: Consider using JavaScript libraries for file handling (like FileReader API) and user interface enhancements (like progress bars or modal windows).

2. Back-End Requirements:

Server-Side Scripting Language:
You'll need a server-side scripting language like Python or Node.js to handle the actual encryption/decryption logic.

Cryptography Library:
A library like cryptography (Python) or crypto-js (JavaScript) is required to implement the Fernet cipher for encryption and decryption operations.

# Instructions

1.	We will first select an audio file by clicking on the “choose file’ button
2.	 A pop up menu will open where we can browse and select the file we wish to encrypt.
3.	 Then click on the “Submit” button.
4.	 The code will take some time to encrypt the file depending on its size and will then show you an option to download the encrypted file.
5.	 A pop up menu will open where we can browse and select the folder/destination in which we want to save the encrypted file.
6.	 The same process is to be followed while decryption. Just make sure the decryption button is enabled.
